\section{The role of security of tenure}

The economics literature on rent controls has much to say about efficient allocation, property values, maintenance and the supply and demand for rental housing, but unfortunately economists and other commentators rarely seem to have anything to say about security of tenure.\footnote{\label{^jenkins-2009-note} For example, in 2009 Blair Jenkins looked at over fifty economics papers and did not see fit to include anything on security of tenure.\cite{^jenkins-2009}}

The omission is glaring. In a 2003 paper reviewing tenancy rent controls, Richard Arnott noted that:

>Almost all economists lead financially secure lives and were raised by parents who emphasized responsibility and self-discipline. They have little or no personal experience with the insecurity that is ever-present in the lives of the less advantaged—those from dysfunctional families, those not raised to middle-class values, and the less able—who tend to live from one paycheck to the next. Not surprisingly, therefore, most economists ignore or underemphasise the importance of security of tenure in rental housing, even though it is consistently second only to affordability on the list of concerns raised by tenant groups.\cite{^arnott-2003-2}

Security of tenure is the idea that you have the right to occupy your home and be protected from being forced to leave against your will. By way of contrast, a homeowner's right to security of tenure is usually taken for granted. So long as they're current on mortgage payments (if any), taxes, etc, a homeowner is protected from involuntary eviction. That security is not absolute, of course: they may be expropriated or rising interest rates may render them unable to afford their home, but by and large "they cannot be forced out at the whim of someone else".\cite{^yee-1989}

By default in most common law jurisdictions tenants do not have this security. They may be denied a renewal of their lease, they may be subject to seizure by landlords who simply dislike them, or they may be 'economically evicted' due to arbitrary increases in their rent. Providing tenants with security of tenure, i.e. protection from involuntary or arbitrary eviction, requires that we not only ensure that housing units are well-maintained and safe for inhabitation, but also that we prevent landlords from unduly exercising their economic power over tenants. 

Earlier, we examined the theoretical basis for a well-designed rent control, and concluded that it was an ineffective tool for preserving affordability or preventing gentrification. However, rent regulations do seem to be effective at keeping current tenants in their homes. 

For example, consider the case of Massachusetts, which abolished its rent controls in 1994. Four years later, the \emph{Economist} reported that in Cambridge "nearly 40\% of tenants in regulated flats moved out after rent control ended", and that "decontrolled rents overall jumped by more than 50\% between 1994 and 1997".\cite{^economist-1998}  David Sims, writing in 2007 about the same decontrol event, found that "decontrol is associated with a decrease of renter stays of 1.84 years", which is rather "sizeable when compared to the mean renter stay of 6 years in the sample".\cite{^sims-2007} This is framed as a loss of efficiency in terms of labour mobility, but I'm not sure it's that cut and dry. 

Most striking is the result from Rebecca Diamond et al's research. Diamond et al frame rent regulations as a kind of insurance against rent increases whose cost in practice is borne by all tenants, as the restriction in supply causes unregulated or vacant rents to rise more than they would have otherwise. They then found that tenants receiving rent control were up to 20\% likelier to remain in their apartments and that "absent rent control essentially all of those incentivized to stay in their apartments would have otherwise moved out of San Francisco". Diamond et al conclude that the gains in welfare those tenants experience narrowly outweigh the resulting deadweight loss incurred on others, but argue that providing this insurance function directly as a government subsidy or tax credit would be more efficient.\footnote{\label{^practical-insurance}  I'm not sure that insurance is practical. Insurance can either be privately mandated or publically provided. A private mandate is a non-starter; a control at least saves us from the cost of an administrative apparatus. A public provision is more appealing. On the one hand, funding it from the population at large would be more progressive than just across tenants. On the other hand  every public insurance function I can think of eventually acts to cap costs and so it's not clear to me landlords would end up in a significantly different position. That said, a public rent insurance program could be very politically useful: it would re-normalize the routine direct public provision of housing services.}\cite{^diamond-2017}

Given that the welfare gains for San Francisco alone are measured in the billions of dollars, that could be a sizeable intervention. But why shouldn't we intervene? After all, we substantially subsidize private ownership. Its relative attractiveness as an investment is the direct result of government policy. The relative scarcity of land via exclusionary zoning is a government policy. Financial liberalization and the coupling of capital markets to home financing was the result of government policy. 

Most suggestions for how to improve the affordability of rental buildings involve either direct subsidies or the reinstitution of tax shelters, and the extent to which they are built at all today in Canada would not happen without the direct intervention of a government agency, the CMHC. It's not like our housing markets exist in a state of nature.

\subsection{A brief history of housing in Canada}

Property rights and the markets they enable exist to the extent they are enforced and protected by the state. When we establish and regulate rights, we typically seek to balance the interests and concerns of everyone involved, and revisit those tradeoffs as our values and goals shift over time. We think our food should be safe to eat, our doctors should be well trained, and that you shouldn't dump waste anywhere you feel like.

In Canada, it would be difficult to identify a time when we had a completely laissez faire housing market. Some of our earliest municipal bylaws regulated building standards. First, we sought to improve our health, safety, fire and construction standards, and later we gradually began to add a host of land use and development regulations.\cite{^hulchanski-laissez}

These regulations led to the elimination of unhealthy, unsafe and poor quality housing in urban areas. If in 1951 almost one out of every ten houses lacked basic plumbing facilities, by 1982 that had dropped to 1.6\%.\cite{^brescia-2005-4} However, our improved housing standards and growing restrictions on land use led to an increase in the cost of its manufacture. As early as 1914 it became apparent that the private market alone was not providing enough low income housing.\cite{^hulchanski-laissez}

One intervention begat another. Federal incentives were introduced in 1938 to stimulate the development of low income rental housing, and by 1949 the government began to invest directly in its production.\cite{^hulchanski-laissez} Buoyed by the post-war economic and population boom,  we began to seriously expand our welfare state and, concerned with ensuring "enough rental housing production to nourish the golden goose of urban growth", from 1965 to 1995 up to 10\% of all new housing was some mix of social housing.\cite{^suttor-abridged}

These interventions were not limited to the poor; quite the opposite. In 1946, the CMHC was established with the aim of increasing home ownership among the broad middle and lower-middle class. Focusing mainly on making amortized mortgages work for house buyers and private investors in rental housing, by the mid-1960s most households obtained at least part of their mortgage loan directly from the federal government.\cite{^hulchanski-bulletin38}

In fact, most of the history of the role of Canadian government housing policy is an effort to assist ownership. In 2005 alone, more individual homeowners were helped through mortgage insurance than the number of all social housing units funded since the 1970s. And in addition to creating cheaper loans, the federal government also provides subsidies through a variety of tax credits, tax sheltered investment vehicles and tax exemptions. When the federal government began taxing capital gains it exempted the sale of primary residence -- which by 2008 was costing us almost \$6 billion a year in uncollected revenue.\cite{^hulchanski-bulletin38}

In so far that our housing policy has targeted the middle class' standard of living, it has been rather successful. As an investment asset, home ownership confers unique benefits: it provides shelter as well as equity that can be withdrawn later in life. Canadians who pay off their mortgages spend on average only 11\% of their income on housing and, by 1999, the average homeowner earned 208\% more income, and owned 70 times more wealth, than the average tenant.\cite{^hulchanski-bulletin38}

\subsection{Tenants have rights, too}

This is to say: "what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy?" and consequently "what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system?" have been considered important questions for over a century -- and our answers to these questions have shifted over time. We began by regulating the safety of our housing, and today we significantly subsidize its ownership for those who can afford it. 

Similarly, our perception of the nature of the relationship between property owners and tenants has also shifted.\footnote{\label{^yorke-2015-note}  I haven't been able to corroborate this quote but it's eye popping:

\begin{quote}
"The next year, 1969, the Vancouver Tenants Council \textbf{campaigned actively for the right of tenants to vote in civic elections,} for enforcement of the building code, for changes in the Landlord and Tenant Act, for abolition of the Distress Act, and that landlords be compelled to give reasons for evictions."
\end{quote}

I knew that in both Vancouver and Toronto non-resident property owners get to vote (presumably since they pay property taxes) but it blew my mind that this wasn't originally extended to \emph{tenants}!\cite{^yorke-2015}}

Under common law, which concerned itself with a leaseholder's (agricultural) relationship to the land, a landlord was under no statutory requirement to maintain the premises or conduct any repairs -- nor were there any limits on their power to evict or even seize the property of tenants. A review of the applicable laws in 1968 found that landlords possessed such a disparity of bargaining power that tenants did not have a freedom of contract in any real sense.\cite{^hulchanski-tenant-rights}

For a variety of ethical, legal and economic reasons, it became clear that tenants deserved protection, and that applying old-school land law principles to the modern urban apartment rental was totally unsuitable. Gradually the law caught up: Ontario adopted its first residential protection laws in 1970, while the notion that tenants deserve security of tenure was added by 1975. Today, landlords are seen as responsible for providing safe and livable accommodations, and that tenants should be protected from arbitrary evictions.\cite{^yee-1989}

Often, this is framed as a conflict of self-interests between landlords and tenants; tenants suffer disproportionate costs when forced to move, and benefit from stability. In a perfect market, tenants should be on average free from arbitrary increases or poorly maintained units due to the emancipating effect of competition. But in practice, that doesn't seem to describe reality. Given the possibility of economic eviction, the regulation of security of tenure must be accompanied by the regulation of rent.\cite{^hulchanski-1984} David Hulchanski, writing over thirty years ago, compares rent regulations to consumer protection laws: 

\begin{quote}

"Where the rental market cannot function normally, such as in meeting supply, or when moving costs limit the mobility of consumer rental services \[...\] regulations protect consumers who find themselves in inferior bargaining positions".\cite{^hulchanski-1984}
\end{quote}

Every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and in that light we can compare the regulation of rent with the regulation of fire safety. Mandating that landlords' properties satisfy certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs and therefore diminishes the affordability of housing. Though some are happy to make that macabre argument,\footnote{\label{^mcardle-2017-note} "It’s possible that by allowing large residential buildings to operate without sprinkler systems, the British government has prevented untold thousands of people from being driven into homelessness by higher housing costs. \[...\] Hold these possibilities in mind before condemning those who chose to spend government resources on other priorities. Regulatory decisions are never without costs, and sometimes their benefits are invisible."\cite{^mcardle-2017}} by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing: individual people are rarely in position to demand improved construction standards, and fires impose costs on everyone around it. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable: in Ontario, only about 7 people per million die every year in residential fires.\cite{^fire-deaths}

And, much like fire safety, security of tenure doesn't just benefit individual tenants. The stability provided by security of tenure is the stuff from which well functioning communities are made of.
